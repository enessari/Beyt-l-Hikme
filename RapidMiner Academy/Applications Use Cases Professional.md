## AI Temelleri, Veri Bilimi ve Makine Öğrenmesi

### Veri Bilimine Giriş ve Makine Öğrenmesi Türleri

#### Veri Bilimi Nedir?

Yaygın olarak kullanılan terimlerin bazılarını açığa çıkarmakla başlayalım ...

>
> Data Science is the practical application of all those elds (AI, ML, DL) in a business
> context.  “Business” here is a exible term since it could also cover a case where you
> work on scientic research.  In this case your “business” is science.  Which actually is
> more true than you want to think about.
> But whatever the context of your application is, the goals are always the same:
> extracting insights from data,
> predicting developments,
> deriving the best actions for an optimal outcome,
> or sometimes even perform those actions in an automated fashion.
> As you can also see in the diagram above, Data Science covers more than the
> application of only those techniques.  It also covers related elds like traditional
> statistics and the visualization of data or results.   Finally, Data Science also includes
> the necessary data preparation to get the analysis done.  In fact, this is where you will
> spend most of your time on as a data scientist.
> A more traditional denition describes a data scientist as somebody with
> programming skills, statistical knowledge, and business understanding. And while
> this indeed is a skill mix which allows you to do the job of a data scientist, this
> denition falls a bit short.  Others realized this as well which led to a battle of Venn
> diagrams.
> The problem is that people can be good data scientists even if they do not write a
> single line of code. And other data scientists can create great predictive models with
> the help of the right tools.  But without a deeper understanding of statistics.  So the
> “unicorn” data scientist (who can master all the skills at the same time) is not only
> overpaid and hard to nd.  It might also be unnecessary.
> For this reason, I like the denition above more which focuses on the “what” and less
> on the “how”.  Data scientists are people who apply all those analytical
> techniques and the necessary data preparation in the context of a business
> application.  The tools do not matter to me as long as the results are correct and
> reliable.





#### Yapay Zeka (AI), Makine Öğrenmesi ve Derin Öğrenme Nedir?

Biri, diğerinin parçası olan, diğerinin bir parçası! Bir dakika ne...??? Hangisi ve hangisi? RapidMiner'ın Kurucusu ve Baş Veri Bilimcisi Ingo Mierswa tarafından yazılan bu belge karışıklığı gidermeye yardımcı olacak ve herkes için.

> There is hardly a day where there is no news on articial intelligence in the media.  Below

> - *This robot explains why you shouldn’t worry about articial intelligence* – yes,

>   nay-sayers even more…
> - *How articial intelligence learns to be racist – simple: it’s mimicking us*
> - *How Articial Intelligence Might Transform the Engineering Industry*

#### What Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning CAN do – and what NOT

By now you should be clear on the terminology but what's behind the hype? Is this AI-ML-Data-Science-Deep-learning stuff going to change the way of how you and everyone does business and can it help you to gain a competitive advantage? As so often the answer is: "It depends". This brief article by RapidMiner's Ingo Mierswa may help to get some clarity.

> fashion.  But at the end of the day, those single big decisions are often very strategic. 
> Building a machine learning model or an AI to help you making this decision is not worth

> your own.
> Here is where ML and AI can help. Machine Learning and Articial Intelligence deliver
> most value whenever you need to make lots of similar decisions quickly. Good
> examples for this are:
> Dening the price of a product in markets with rapidly changing demands,
> Making oers for cross-selling in an E-Commerce platform,
> Approving a credit or not,
> Detecting customers with a high risk for churn,
> Stopping fraudulent transactions,
> …among others.
> You can see that a human being who would have access to all relevant data could make
> those decisions in a matter of seconds or minutes.  Only that they can’t without AI or ML,
> since they would need to make this type of decision millions of times, every day.  Like
> sifting through your customer base of 50 million clients every day to identify those with a
> high churn risk.  Impossible for any human being.  But no problem at all for an ML
> model.
> So, the biggest value of articial intelligence and machine learning is not to support us
> with those big strategic decisions.  Machine learning delivers most value when we
> operationalize models and automate millions of decisions.
> The image below shows this spectrum of decisions and the times humans need to make
> those.  The blue boxes are situations where analytics can help, but it is not providing its
> full value. The orange boxes are situations where AI and ML show real value. And the
> interesting observation is: the more decisions you can automate, the higher this value
> will be (upper right end of this spectrum).

### From Descriptive to Predictive and Prescriptive

#### Introduction To Advanced Analytics

Advanced Analytics is defined as: "The analysis of all kinds of data using sophisticated quantitative methods (for example, statistics, descriptive and predictive data mining, simulation and optimization) to produce insights that traditional approaches to business intelligence (BI) — such as query and reporting — are unlikely to discover."

This only begins to scratch the surface of the field. Analytics is an immense field with many subfields, so it can be difficult to sort out all the buzzwords around it. This whitepaper outlines the differences between Advanced Analytics, Business Intelligence, and their subfields to provide you with an understanding of how they fit into the overall category of Analytics.

Read this white paper to learn more about the differences between advanced analytics and business intelligence.

#### Back to the Future or "how to get predictive"

Before you even start figuring out how to create great analytical workflows and solve your problems, you need to make a mapping between your business problem and an analytical technique, and that turns out to be really, really difficult. So, many people out there don't get it right, but it's actually super simple and Ingo is going to explain to you how it boils down to two questions only.

#### Prescriptive Analytics

Ingo Mierswa, RapidMiner's data science wizard, feels a bit left out in the rain but somehow he manages to turn this around into a lecture on prescriptive analytics and telling others if they should bring an umbrella or not. Now that's a positive attitude! He details how prescriptive analytics combines both, machine learning models and optimization schemes. Knowing something about the future is one thing, but actually changing something about the future is more valuable, right? Also Data Scientist #7 shows his true colors...
